# Technical Implementation Document: Frontend (Vue.js + Tailwind CSS)

## 1. Overview
The frontend will be a modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue.js 3, using Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. It will consume the backend API, provide real-time queue updates, and offer distinct experiences for Admin, Doctor, and Patient roles.

---

## 2. Key Requirements
- **SPA:** Built with Vue.js 3 and Vite.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first, responsive design.
- **State Management:** Pinia (recommended for Vue 3).
- **Routing:** Vue Router for navigation and role-based route protection.
- **API Integration:** Axios for HTTP requests to the Laravel backend.
- **Real-Time:** Integration with Laravel Echo and Pusher (or native WebSockets) for queue updates.
- **Role-Based UI:** Separate dashboards and navigation for Admin, Doctor, and Patient.
- **Authentication:** Token-based (consume Laravel Sanctum API).
- **Testing:** Vitest or Jest for unit/component tests.
- **Documentation:** README, user guide, and API usage instructions.

## 4. Dependencies (2024 Best Practices)
- **Vue.js 3** (`vue@^3`)
- **Vite** (`vite@latest`)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (`tailwindcss@^4`)
- **Pinia** (`pinia@latest`)
- **Vue Router** (`vue-router@latest`)
- **Axios** (`axios@latest`)
- **@headlessui/vue** (for accessible UI components)
- **@heroicons/vue** (for icons)
- **Laravel Echo** and **Pusher JS** (for real-time, optional)
- **Vitest** or **Jest** (for testing)

## 5. Core Concepts & Implementation

### 5.1. Routing & Role-Based Access
- Use Vue Router for navigation.
- Define routes for login, registration, dashboards, appointments, queue, etc.
- Use navigation guards to restrict access based on user role.

### 5.2. State Management
- Use Pinia for global state (user session, roles, queue status).
- Store authentication token securely (preferably HttpOnly cookies, or localStorage as fallback).

### 5.3. API Integration
- Create a centralized Axios service (`src/services/api.js`) for all HTTP requests.
- Handle authentication, error responses, and token refresh logic.

### 5.4. Real-Time Queue Updates
- Integrate Laravel Echo and Pusher (or WebSockets) to listen for queue events.
- Update queue state in real-time for both doctors and patients.

### 5.5. UI & Components
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Build reusable components: buttons, forms, modals, tables, notifications.
- Use Headless UI and Heroicons for accessible, modern UI elements.

### 5.6. Pages & Layouts
- **Auth Pages:** Login, Register, Forgot Password.
- **Dashboards:** Separate layouts for Admin, Doctor, Patient.
- **Appointments:** Book, view, manage appointments.
- **Queue:** Real-time queue position, call next.
- **Profile:** View/edit user details.

```

---

## 7. Testing
- Use Vitest or Jest for unit/component tests.
- Test user flows: login, booking, queue updates.
- (Optional) Use Cypress for end-to-end testing.

---

## 8. Documentation
- **README.md:** Setup, build, and deployment instructions.
- **User Guide:** Screenshots, feature walkthroughs.
- **API Usage:** How frontend interacts with backend endpoints.

---

## 9. Risks & Considerations
- **API Consistency:** Ensure frontend and backend API contracts match.
- **Real-Time Complexity:** WebSocket integration and state sync.
- **Role Management:** UI/UX must clearly separate roles and permissions.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure app is usable for all users.
